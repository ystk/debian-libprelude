Description: Security Information Management System [ Development files ]
 Prelude is a Universal "Security Information Management" (SIM) system.
 Its goals are performance and modularity. It is divided in two main
 parts :
  - the Prelude sensors, responsible for generating alerts, such as
    snort featuring a signature engine, plugins for
    protocol analysis, and intrusion detection plugins, and the Prelude
    log monitoring lackey.
  - the Prelude report server, collecting data from Prelude sensors,
    and generating user-readable reports.
 .
 This package contains the development files for Prelude components.
